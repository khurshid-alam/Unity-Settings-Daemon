unity-settings-daemon (14.04.0+14.04.20140310-0ubuntu2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * unity-settings-demon.user-session.upstart: Use XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
    as the instance specifier for gnome-session upstart jobs, since
    other sessions apart from ubuntu will need to use u-s-d (LP: #1224217)

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * Backport some small upstream bugfixes
  * Enforce schemas from the same serie, some ppa are shipping newer
    versions of gnome-settings-daemon which drop keys and that's leading
    to reports against unity-settings-daemon. That way users are warned
    and get to choose what option they want.

  [ Luke Yelavich ]
  * Look for gtk-modules related files in the correct location.

  [ Lars Uebernickel ]
  * media-keys: add support for allow-amplified-volume When that key is
    set, the maximum volume is PA_VOLUME_UI_MAX instead of
    PA_VOLUME_NORM. This makes it consistent with the sound indicator
    and system settings.

  * Instead of autodetecting the scaling factor, default to 1 if the key
    is set to '0'. unity-control-center should be calculating the value
    and setting this key accordingly, otherwise the Unity and gtk values
    can get out of sync.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Always use gnome-screenshot directly, not the gnome-shell screenshot
    interface. We aren't using the legacy keygrabber under Unity, but
    neither can we use gnome-shell's interface since Unity doesn't
    implement it. (LP: #1282649)

  [ David Henningsson ]
  * Handle unknown audio jack devices.

  [ William Hua ]
  * Revert the legacy key grabber. (LP: #1226962)

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * backport upstream change to support hi-dpi screens/scaling. You can
    change the scaling value by writting the
    "org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor" gsettings key

  * Change power notifications from popups (expire never), to notify-osd
    bubbles (default timeout).
  * Start on gnome-session (ubuntu instance) only (for now).

  * Fork gnome-settings-daemon so we can maintain it for Unity 7 until it is
    replaced by the Unity 8 equivalent.

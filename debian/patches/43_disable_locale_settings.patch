Description: Make sure that no locales are set, even if the gsettings "region" key has
 been assigned a value in the past, since they are set in Ubuntu via ~/.pam_environment.
Forwarded: not-needed

* The set_locale() function is questionable anyhow, since it's called after ~/.profile
* is sourced by e.g. lightdm or gdm, which prevents users from fine tuning the locale
* settings by editing ~/.profile.
